== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the setting for this plugin? =

This plugin will add the settings to the Settings tab, to be found in the Settings > Kmetric Tracking menu.

= I don't see the code on my site. Where is it? =

We purposefully don't track admin visits to the site. Log out of the site (or open a Google Chrome Incognito window) and check if the site is there for non-admins.

Also please make sure your Kmetric Product ID under Settings > Kmetric Tracking.

= My code is there. Why is it still not tracking sales?  =

Duplicate Kmetric Analytics code causes a conflict in tracking. Remove any other Kmetric Analytics plugin or code from your site to avoid duplication and conflicts in tracking.
